# Theseus: A Basic T2V Model Inspired by CogVideoX

This repository contains a very basic implementation of the ideas presented in the CogVideoX paper, including 3D attention mechanisms and causal convolutional layers. The results shown were obtained after training for 100 epochs on a mini-dataset of 10 videos using a NVIDIA T4 GPU on Google Colab.

## Overview

Theseus is a simplified Text-to-Video (T2V) model that leverages core concepts from the CogVideoX architecture. While not a complete implementation, it provides a foundational framework to explore the intersection of text and video modalities through deep learning.

Complete update of the model, and the results of the new implementation will be presented soon :b


## Dataset

The model was trained on a small dataset consisting of 10 videos. The dataset was selected to demonstrate the basic functionality of the Theseus model on limited resources.
